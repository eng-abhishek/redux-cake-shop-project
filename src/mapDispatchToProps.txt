✅ What is mapDispatchToProps?

mapDispatchToProps is a function that lets your React component send actions to the Redux store.

👉 It basically provides functions in your component that can dispatch Redux actions.

🧠 Syntax
const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => {
  return {
    someFunction: () => dispatch(someAction())
  };
};


Then connect:

export default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(MyComponent);

🧩 Example (Cake Example)

Suppose you have an action:

// cakeActions.js
export const buyCake = () => {
  return {
    type: 'BUY_CAKE'
  }
}


Component:

import React from "react";
import { connect } from "react-redux";
import { buyCake } from "../redux/cake/cakeActions";

function CakeContainer(props) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Number of cakes: {props.numOfCakes}</h2>
      <button onClick={props.buyCake}>Buy Cake</button>
    </div>
  );
}

👉 Using mapDispatchToProps
const mapStateToProps = (state) => {
  return {
    numOfCakes: state.cake.numberOfCakes
  };
};

const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => {
  return {
    buyCake: () => dispatch(buyCake())
  };
};

export default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(CakeContainer);

📌 What happens?
Without Redux

You just call a function.

With mapDispatchToProps

The function you call (props.buyCake()) will dispatch the action → reducer → update store → component re-renders.

🧾 Shortcut Version

React-Redux allows shorthand if your action creators return objects.

Instead of:

const mapDispatchToProps = dispatch => {
  return {
    buyCake: () => dispatch(buyCake())
  }
}


You can do:

export default connect(
  mapStateToProps,
  { buyCake }
)(CakeContainer);


React-Redux automatically wraps buyCake in dispatch.

💡 When do we use mapDispatchToProps?

✔ When you want to call Redux actions from your component
✔ When you use the connect() API (not hooks)
✔ When your component needs to update the Redux state

# Question:: if i am using redux-hooks then how can be short above example ???

✅ Short version using Redux Hooks (useSelector + useDispatch)

Here is the same example using hooks:

✔ Component (very short)
import React from "react";
import { useSelector, useDispatch } from "react-redux";
import { buyCake } from "../redux/cake/cakeActions";

function CakeContainer() {
  const numOfCakes = useSelector((state) => state.cake.numberOfCakes);
  const dispatch = useDispatch();

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Number of cakes: {numOfCakes}</h2>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch(buyCake())}>Buy Cake</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default CakeContainer;

🚀 What happened?
With connect

mapStateToProps

mapDispatchToProps

connect()

With hooks

useSelector replaces mapStateToProps

useDispatch replaces mapDispatchToProps

No connect() needed

Code becomes very short and easy

📌 Comparison
🔴 Old (connect + mapStateToProps + mapDispatchToProps)
const mapStateToProps = state => ({
  numOfCakes: state.cake.numberOfCakes
});

const mapDispatchToProps = dispatch => ({
  buyCake: () => dispatch(buyCake())
});

export default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(CakeContainer);

🟢 New (hooks)
const numOfCakes = useSelector(state => state.cake.numberOfCakes);
const dispatch = useDispatch();

🏆 Final Summary
Without Hooks	With Hooks
Uses connect()	No connect
Uses mapStateToProps	useSelector
Uses mapDispatchToProps	useDispatch
More code	Much shorter

If you want, I can convert your own component from connect() style to hooks.

You said:
then why we learn mapDispatchToProps
ChatGPT said:

Great question!
Many beginners get confused about why we learn mapDispatchToProps if hooks (useDispatch, useSelector) make things easier.

Here is the clear and simple answer 👇

✅ Why do we learn mapDispatchToProps even if hooks exist?

There are 4 important reasons:

1️⃣ Because many old/enterprise React-Redux projects still use it

Before 2019, React-Redux did not have hooks.

So 80% of existing codebases in companies still use:

connect()

mapStateToProps

mapDispatchToProps

👉 If you work on real-world projects, you will definitely see these.

2️⃣ You need it to understand how React-Redux works internally

Hooks are simpler, but they hide some concepts.

Understanding mapDispatchToProps helps you understand:

how actions go from component → dispatch → reducer

how connect() wraps your component

how props come from Redux store

It builds strong fundamentals.

3️⃣ Some situations still prefer connect()

Even today, connect() + mapStateToProps can be faster than hooks in some large apps because:

connect uses memoization

reduces unnecessary re-renders

good for performance optimization

So advanced developers still use it sometimes.

4️⃣ Interview Questions

Almost every React-Redux interview asks:

What is mapStateToProps?

What is mapDispatchToProps?

connect vs hooks?

Why use useDispatch instead of mapDispatchToProps?

So you must know both.

📌 Simple Summary
Hooks = Modern, Short, Easy

Use in new projects.

mapDispatchToProps = Old but still important

Used in older projects + interviews + fundamentals + performance cases.

🧭 Final Understanding

✔ You will use hooks in new projects
✔ You will see mapDispatchToProps in old/real-world code
✔ So learning both makes you a complete React-Redux developer
